      <p>Welcome to Rainward, the web app for finding dreary and drizzly travel destinations, based on their five-day forecasts.</p>

      <p>Rainward ranks locations based on their forecasted temperature, precipitation, wind, and cloudiness, using the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a> API.</p>

      <p>The Wool Sock Rating of displayed destinations can be used to determine how dreary the top-ranked cities are forecasted to be. Three wool socks indicates very inclement weather in the forecast. Two wool indicates some inclement weather. One wool sock indicates little or no inclement weather.</p>

      <p>This application was created by <a href="http://rachelsalois.com/">Rachel Salois</a>, a web developer living in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
